Task 3: A/B Testing Analysis - 
Conduct an A/B testing analysis to evaluate the impact of a change or intervention. Analyze the results using statistical techniques and draw actionable insights.

1. **Import Libraries:** Begin by importing essential Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scipy.stats for data manipulation, numerical operations, and statistical testing, respectively.

3. **Load A/B Testing Data:** Use pandas to load your A/B testing data from a CSV file ('ab_testing_data.csv' in this case) into a DataFrame named 'ab_data'.

5. **Group Data:** Assume 'group' is the column indicating group membership (A or B), and 'outcome' is the binary outcome variable. Create separate datasets ('group_a_data' and 'group_b_data') for groups A and B.

6. **Conduct Two-Sample T-Test:** Utilize the ttest_ind function from scipy.stats to perform a two-sample t-test on the two groups. This tests whether there is a significant difference between the means of the two independent samples.

7. **Display Results:** Print the calculated t-statistic and p-value to assess the statistical significance of the observed difference between groups.

8. **Determine Statistical Significance:** Set a significance level (alpha) at 0.05 and compare it with the p-value. If the p-value is less than alpha, conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between groups.

9. **Effect Size Calculation:** Compute Cohen's d as a measure of effect size, providing insight into the practical significance of the observed difference.

Each step serves a specific purpose: loading and organizing the data, conducting a statistical test, interpreting results based on significance levels, and calculating an effect size for a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the change or intervention in the A/B testing scenario.
